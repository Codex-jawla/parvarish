      <p>
      We are working in education field where there is no institutional source of education. As most of the places have schools but there is no carrier guiding or preparation centres. This is the major cause of backwardness there as we think. Most of the people who get education move away from these places. This creates a gap between rural and urban development. We are working to fulfill this gap.
