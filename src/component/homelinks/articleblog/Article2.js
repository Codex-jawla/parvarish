  <div className='heading'><h2>Are you a perfectionist? Do you have perfection syndrome?</h2></div>
  <div className="onlyheadingtxt"><p>Well, I always tried to be perfect on everything I did. It gave me satisfaction and often appreciation if successful. But it also put extra pressure as well as pain in case of failure. At one point I realized that perfection is needed but not necessarily on everything! For example, perfection for a Neurosurgeon is needed while doing a brain surgery but it is not necessary while having a dinner with steak! Shouldn’t the perfection level of spacecraft be different from lawn mower?Now the question is, what level of perfection is needed from whom, and on what?
I was listening to a Swedish author and below are few aspects to consider to be free ourselves from perfection;
Control: Do we really need to be in control of everything? It is important to understand what to control and what to let go.
Compete: Do we really need to compete on everything? Ask yourself with whom and for what reason are you competing.
Fail: Admit failure instead of blaming someone or something.
Expectation: Why should you put high expectation on yourself or on others? Is that justified? Is that clearly communicated?
All or nothing: The all or nothing approach doesn’t work in the long term, we must learn how to negotiate and compromise if needed.
Inner clubs: We have two inner clubs, an ‘Inner critic’ and a ‘Fan’ club. The Inner critic club members blame and put things down, and the Fan club members praise and cheer things up. It’s up to you to decide which club to patronize.
Salvador Dali once stated, “Have no fear of perfection - you’ll never reach it.” Let us be free from perfectionism. In most cases, good enough is good enough.</p></div>
